# üê≥ Deploying with Docker Compose

There are mainly 3 ways to deploy `@alpa/api` onto production. For personal usage deploying through üê≥ **Docker Compose** is the easiest & recommended way.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** For advanced use cases or high intensity workload read about [manual deployment](./manual.md) & [Kubernetes deployment](./kubernetes.md).

Deploying **alpa**'s API using Docker is easy and straightforward by following the below steps:

## üîç Prerequisites

1. [Docker v20.10.13](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) or higher
2. [Docker Compose v2.3.2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command) or [`docker-compose` v1.29.2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## üöÄ Deployment process

Once you've satisfied the prerequisites, follow the below steps to configure `@alpa/api` to run in production.

### üìÇ Create a new folder

Create a new folder named `alpa` and enter into it, this is where we'll store the `docker-compose.yml` and other artifacts generated for running all the services we need, by running üëá the following command:

```
mkdir ./alpa && cd ./alpa
```

### üìÉ Creating `docker-compose.yml` file

The first thing we'll do in the newly created folder is create a `docker-compose.yml` file which defines all the services that are required for `@alpa/api`.

Open your favourite text editor (preferably [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)), copy the below code block üëá and save it as `docker-compose.yml` in the `alpa` directory.

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
    # the redis Docker image with RedisJSON and RediSearch
    # modules pre-configured & enabled along with persistance
    redis:
        image: redislabs/redisearch:2.4.0
        container_name: redis
        command: redis-server --loadmodule /usr/lib/redis/modules/redisearch.so --loadmodule /usr/lib/redis/modules/rejson.so --appendonly yes
        volumes:
            - .redis:/data
    
    # @alpa/api Docker image
    alpa-api:
        image: vsnthdev/alpa-api:v{{api.app.version}}
        container_name: alpa-api
        ports:
            - 1727:1727
        volumes:
            - ./config.yml:/opt/alpa/api/config.yml
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** We're intensionally using a versioned images, to mitigate the risk of accidentally updating the image and breaking everything.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Mounting configuration file

An example config file will all possible values already exists in this repository. Simply right click on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsnthdev/alpa/main/api/config.example.yml) and select "_Save as_".

Now save it with the name `config.yml` in the `alpa` folder where `docker-compose.yml` is. Once done your `alpa` folder should contain two files

```
docker-compose.yml
config.yml
```

### ‚ö° Production configuration

Provided example config file is best suitable for development & testing purposes only. We need to make some changes to the config file to make `@alpa/api` suitable for production environments.

These exact changes have been specified in the manual deployment docs **[click here to view them](./manual.md#-production-configuration).**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Do not use `@alpa/api` in production without following the production configuration steps. It will lead to serious security risks and instabilities.

### ‚ú® Starting `@alpa/api`

With the above mentioned changes being done to the configuration file, `@alpa/api` is now ready to be started in a production environment safely.

To start all the services defined in our `docker-compose.yml` run üëá one of the below commands depending on your Docker Compose version:

```bash
# if you're on Docker Compose v2
docker compose up

# if you're on docker-compose v1
docker-compose up
```

After following the above steps you should be able to login from the configured client and start enjoying **alpa**.
